* Add a way to support pictures (see how sphinx makes that)
* Find a way to extend the existing templates instead of rewriting all from scratch.
* find a better way to specify the templates. an idea is simply to install the templates in a default path, and to add a way to specify them by default under a "_themes" dir.
* Make the program support UTF8-encoded files as input (and later: any encoding?)
* Change the directory structure ?
* Add status support (draft, published, hidden)
* Add a serve + automatic generation behaviour.
* Recompile only the changed files, not all.
* Add a way to make the cofee (it's really something useful)
