* Add a way to support pictures (see how sphinx makes that)
* Find a way to extend the existing templates instead of rewriting all from scratch.
* find a better way to specify the templates. an idea is simply to install the templates in a default path, and to add a way to specify them by default under a "_themes" dir.
* Make the program support UTF8-encoded files as input (and later: any encoding?)
