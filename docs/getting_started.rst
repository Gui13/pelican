Getting started
###############

Installing
==========

You're ready? Let's go ! You can install pelican in a lot of different ways,
the simpler one is via `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_::

    $ pip install pelican

If you have the sources, you can install pelican using the distutils command
install. I recommend to do so in a virtualenv::

    $ virtualenv .
    $ source bin/activate
    $ python setup.py install

Dependencies
============

At this time, pelican is dependent of the following python packages:

* feedgenerator, to generate the ATOM feeds.
* jinja2, for templating support.
* pygments, to have syntactic colorization
* docutils and Markdown

If you're not using python 2.7, you will also need `argparse`.

All those dependencies will be processed automatically if you install pelican
using setuptools/distribute or pip.

Files metadata
==============

Pelican tries to be smart enough to get the informations he needs from the
file system (for instance, about the category of your articles), but you need to
provide by hand some of those informations in your files.

You could provide the metadata in the restructured text files, using the
following syntax (give your file the `.rst` extension)::

    My super title
    ##############

    :date: 2010-10-03 10:20
    :tags: thats, awesome
    :category: yeah
    :author: Alexis Metaireau


You can also use a markdown syntax (with a file ending in `.md`)::

    Date: 2010-12-03
    Title: My super title

    Put you content here.

Note that none of those are mandatory: if the date is not specified, pelican will
rely on the mtime of your file, and the category can also be determined by the
directory where the rst file is. For instance, the category of
`python/foobar/myfoobar.rst` is `foobar`.

Generate your blog
==================

To launch pelican, just use the `pelican` command::

    $ pelican /path/to/your/content/

Andâ€¦ that's all! You can see your weblog generated on the `content/` folder.

This one will just generate a simple output, with the default theme. It's not
really sexy, as it's a simple HTML output (without any style).

You can create your own style if you want, have a look to the help to see all
the options you can use::

    $ pelican --help

Pages
=====

If you create a folder named `pages`, all the files in it will be used to
generate static pages.

Then, use the `DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU` setting, which will add all the pages to 
the menu.

Translations
============

It is possible to translate articles. To do so, you need to add a `Lang` meta
in your articles/pages, and to set a `DEFAULT_LANG` setting (which is en by
default). Then, only articles with this default language will be listed, and
each article will have a translation list.
